# Lily58 handwired - ZMK config (SuperMini nRF52840)

1. Push this folder to a new GitHub repo (it must include the hidden .github folder).
2. Actions tab -> wait for the build -> download the "firmware" artifact.
3. For each half: short RST to GND twice quickly -> a USB drive (NICENANO) appears -> copy the matching .uf2 onto it.
   - left half:  lily58hw_left-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2  (central; pairs with your computer)
   - right half: lily58hw_right-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2
4. Pair "Lily58" over Bluetooth.

If the halves won't connect: flash settings_reset-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2 to BOTH halves, then re-flash the
normal firmware, then reset both halves at the same time.
